# Miles Per Gallon Tracker

A simple app meant to track the number of miles driven between fillups.

I made it because I got very interested in a certain kind of SQL query,
and wanted to make an app around it. Specifically I was interested in
window functions and recursive CTEs.

# Activities

Layout shall consist of a dropdown menu at the top which contains the
user's cars. At the bottom of that list is an add car button.

The main activity has a floating action button to add a fill up or
event.
